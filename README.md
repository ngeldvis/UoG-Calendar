# UoG Calendar

Web scraper to gets events from the University's [Schedule of Dates](https://calendar.uoguelph.ca/undergraduate-calendar/schedule-dates/) page and add them to a user's google calendar

Potential Future Plans:
- create a database to store calendar events and auto update google calendar when new events are found
- make the calendar subscribable so anyone can use it given a sharable link
