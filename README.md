# UoG Calendar

Unversity of Guelph Google Calendar that automatically gets events from the University's [Schedule of Dates](https://calendar.uoguelph.ca/undergraduate-calendar/schedule-dates/) page

This is currently a work in progress:

Future Plans:
- create a database to store calendar events and auto update google calendar when new events are found
- make the calendar subscribable so anyone can use it given a sharable link
