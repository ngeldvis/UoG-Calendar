Here are a list of exported `.ics` calendars you can import into whatever calendar you'd like

### Google Calendar

To import the `.ics` file to your Google Calendar, download the most recent `.ics` file and go to [calendar.google.com](https://calendar.google.com/). Then, go to Settings > Import & Export > Select file from your computer. You'll then want to locate the file you just downloaded, select the calendar you want to add the events to and click Import.
